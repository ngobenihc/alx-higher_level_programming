# :shell: 0x02 - Using Import and creating modules :shell:

In this project I will be using modules in Python3 to complete various tasks. I will be using and creating modules to familiarize myself with the symbol tables being transfered from file to file. As well as familiarize myself with using `__name__` to dynmaically assert whether a module is being imported or run as a script.

* You Must have `git` installed

* You Must have repository cloned

* You Must have `python3` installed
